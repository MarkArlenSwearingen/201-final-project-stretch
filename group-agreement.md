### Repo Wranglers: Team Agreement

##### Communication plan: 

- We will communicated in person when we're on campus and via Slack when we're off campus. If we get crunched, we'll decide if we need to meet after class in person.
- To ensure everyoneâ€™s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to, before we move forward on any decision we will do an intentional final "poll" of everyone to ask "Are you good with that or do you have any concerns?"
- Regarding psychological safety, we agree that we all want to be stoked about this project. In order to ensure this, at every decision point we will check in with each other to make sure we have buy-in. We agree to voice any concerns that we have during these buy-in check ins.
- "Ask for feedback on delivery" (from hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it ). The person who brings up an idea will proactively ask others for their immediate feedback to make it easier for people to be comfortable giving said feedback.
- "Measure it" (from the article linked above) -- Bring up concerns in the morning standup.

##### Conflict plan: 
- When we encouter conflict, we will sincerely ask the question "How can we achieve a mutually desirable outcome?" and then discuss this. For interpersonal conflict, we commit to each other to bring up our own concerns in a kind way rather than going inside ourselves and shutting down. For coding conflicts if we can't resolve it amongst ourselves, we will ask the instructional team to have them mediate. 
- If something needs to be escalated to the instructional team, we commit to buying in to the final decision they make and moving forward together. 

##### Work plan: 

- We will create very bite-size tasks on project board so that we can each grab parts of that (e.g. create a task on the board for each function within the code)
- We will do 5-10 minute check-in meetings every couple hours to "course-correct" as needed and to see if anyone needs help on their piece (e.g. if we should all stop and mob program, or if expectations needs to be clarified, work needs to be divvied up differently, etc.).
- We will assign tasks on the board first thing in the morning and then again in the afternoon (take what you want to work on that day).
- Our project management tool will be Git Projects (the built-in Kanban board in GitHub).

##### Daily Team Meeting Schedule:
- 09:00 AM standup with instructional team
- 11:00 AM quick 5 minute team check-in
- 01:00 PM group standup to clarify afternoon plan
- 03:00 PM quick 5 minute team check-in
- 04:30 PM group standup to clarify what we are working on over the evening

##### Git Workflow: 

- We will have a Deployment repo and then fork that into a Staging repo.
- From the Staging repo, Holly, Mark, and Trevor will clone the Staging repo to their local machines.
- No coding will be done on our local masters. Whenever a team member goes to work on a feature, they will create a new branch under their local master to do so. They will then push their local branch to the Staging repo. 
- They will then do a PR of their own branch to the Staging repo, but will NOT approve their own PR. When a team member initiates a PR, they will send a message to Trevor in Slack to let him know. 
- Trevor will be the one person who approves PRs to the Staging repo.
- For PRs to the Deployment repo, the group will approve these as a group. 
- Trevor will approve/merge PRs every morning and then everyone will pull down from the Staging repo every morning after this merge.

##### Additional Agreements

- Expectations around work times: We will each do a minimum of an hour work in the evenings (more if we want, but making sure that we get down time and good sleep so we're are fresh for our in-person time). 

- Taking breaks/seeking help: We welcome asking each other for help. We will be considerate if the person needs to finish something up/get to a stopping point. We will typically only ask one of our teammates for help, but depending on the situation, we may all stop what we're doing to mob program on one issue or to rubber duck/pseudo code together.
